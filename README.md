## Abstract

Diversity in host resistance often associates with reduced pathogen spread. This may result from limitation of pathogen evolution, and reduced pathogen reproduction due to the dilution of focal hosts. Theory and experiments on bacteria-phage interactions have shown that genetic diversity of the bacterial adaptive immune system can limit phage evolution to overcome resistance. Here we explore how immune diversity impacts the spread of phage when they can overcome a resistance allele, and whether immune diversity affects the evolution of the phage to increase its host range. We show that higher diversity benefits both susceptible and resistant bacteria by limiting the spread of the phage, and this is linked to a reduced probability that phage acquire further mutations to overcome other resistance alleles. These data highlight the tight link between the epidemiological and evolutionary consequences of host resistance allele diversity and their key consequences for host-pathogen interactions. 

## Contents

Hello! This repo contains all the raw data and associated code used in Common et al (2019) biorXiv. 

Data includes the phage titre and selection rate data collected during the coinfection experiment, as well as data from stamp assays used to assess phage evolution. Included also is the sequence data for the bacteriophage-insensitive mutant (BIM) library and of phage that shifted host. 

The code included is that used to generate raw data figures (Figures 1, S3 & 4), analyse phage titre and selection rates using lme4, analyse phage evolution using MCMCglmm, and the generate the associated summary data and figures (Figures 2, 3, and S2).

I hope that everything makes sense. You are very welcome to contact me on here or via the correspondence email in the paper if you have any queries.
